        <h3>Etiquette</h3>
        <p>It is good practice to make the purchase before collecting the item. You may also wish to put new items into the communal space before selling it to the store. Both of these things should be done as close as possible to one another in time to avoid confusion or incorrect stocktaking.</p>
